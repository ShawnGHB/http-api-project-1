What dataset are you using?
Book dataset

● What went right in the development of this project?
- Working with server side isn't difficult and the actual working in it was simple. 
- The data returns the values requested by it with ease.


● What went wrong in the development of this project?
- I couldn't understand why my head Requests weren't fetching in the Network tab, but they seemed to be set up correctly. 
I tried researching it, but it does seem to process correctly since it follows the same track as GET does.

- Figuring out how to order my JSON object in a way that read nicely for the user yet still parsed easily was difficult.

● What did you learn while developing this project?
- I learned that client side applications still require heavy setup and it really is a conversation. 
I think prior assignments dulled me to the effort that goes into building a nice client side application. 

- I learned how to process URL parameters on the server side of things.

- I learned critical function mapping skills I'll need in the future.

● If you went above and beyond, how did you do so?
N/A

● If you used any borrowed code or code fragments, where did you get them from?
What do the code fragments do? Where are they in your code?
- There is a stack overflow bit of code that I modified to help alphabetically sort the dataset as it returns. I felt it was more intuitive that way.
